# Weather-Dashboard

This weather dashboard helps show the upcoming weather to any city or state you type in the searchbar.

First you must think of a place and type that location into where it says "Enter city name" on the top left.
When you enter that location, you must click the search button on the top right. Once this is done, the forcast for the upcoming days will show up on the page

The first row shows the date.
The second then shows the weather icon for that day.
The third row shows the temperature in fahrenheit for that day.
The fourth shows the humidity for that day.
And lastly, the wind speed should show in the last row.

You must refresh the page to search for a different location.

I hope you enjoy
